# DataViz App - A product of Metric Analytics - Alpha v1.0.0 
Bar Chart Race is available

**WARNING: THE APP IS REALLY FRAGILE (like my heart) SINCE IT'S NOT COMPLETE YET. EDIT FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK**

## The app requires FFMpeg in order to export videos. Please install it here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Instructions are now included within the application. Please read the instructions carefully.

>Made with Matplotlib and Kivy (and tears, due to the bugs)

New update: DataViz App is the app that i exported with pyinstaller. DataViz source is the code i worked on.
